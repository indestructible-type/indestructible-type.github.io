			<p>
				<b>My name is Owen Earl</b><br>
				Welcome to my website! I am in love with letters. I&#8217;ve been designing and making fonts for over five years now. In that time I&#8217;ve done work for some big name companies (Cond&eacute; Nast, Google, etc.), but my true passion is in doing work for the smaller guys. I want to make high quality, versatile, modern typography that's accessible to everybody, not just the big guys.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Services</b><br>
				I make the fonts available on this website, but I do other things too. I do consulting on all matters typographic, I do custom typeface design, and I&#8217;d love to help out on some cutting edge experiments that could use my eye and skillset. If you have questions or are interested in collaborating I encourage you to <span class="Red"><a href="Contact.html">reach out</a></span>.

			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">About the Type</h3>
			<p>
				<b>Indestructible Fonts</b><br>
				Central to the vision of the foundry, is making free, highly versatile, archetypal typography. Fonts that capture the essence of a typographic idea. Fonts that will look good in any context. Fonts that have a full range of widths and styles. Fonts that use the latest technology and design to recreate the best designs of history. These are Indestructible Fonts, and they are the main focus of the foundry.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Experimental Fonts</b><br>
				To make the best possible fonts I have to stay hip to the latest technologies and innovations. This means experimenting and every once and a while inventing new things. The result of some these experiments end up in the Experimental Fonts category. They&#8217;re less practical than the Indestructible Fonts, but they&#8217;re just as important.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>What&#8217;s with the asterisks?</b><br>
				It&#8217;s a trademark of sorts. It helps to easily distinguish indestructible type* fonts from other fonts, while keeping the naming convention simple. It&#8217;s particularly useful for Indestructible Fonts which are named after font designers of the past. For example, there are a lot of fonts named Bodoni, but only one named Bodoni*.
