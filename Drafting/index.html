<p id="text" contenteditable>What's New?<br>This is version 1.1 which now supports <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">small-caps</span> and includes light weights.<br><br><br><br>February 24th, 2021<br><br>To the editor:<br>
I never saw myself making a monospaced font.&nbsp; There already exists a plethora of high-quality, free and open-source monospaced typefaces.&nbsp; Typefaces like <a onclick="window.open('https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono')" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono">IBM Plex Mono</a>, <a  onclick="window.open('https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode')" href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</a>, and <a onclick="window.open('https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono')" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono">Roboto Mono</a>.&nbsp; What could I possibly have to offer in a landscape already saturated with so many good options?&nbsp; Why invest time and energy catering to a need that doesn't exist?
<br><br>
But I am a designer, not just a font-maker, and I noticed something within my design practice: I kept reaching for something that wasn't quite there, a font that other typefaces came close to but didn't quite achieve.&nbsp; There was a hole in my typographic toolkit.
<br><br>
As a designer I love monospaced typefaces.&nbsp; There's something weirdly personal about them, like you're getting a behind-the-scenes look at the world.&nbsp; Programmers use them to code, movie scripts are written in them, and when book manuscripts are submitted to publishers, they're written in a monospaced font.&nbsp; There's something about them that screams, "this project is still in the works!" and I like that.
<br><br>
I like how they remind me of typewriters, of telegraphs and love poems.&nbsp; They remind me of library card catalogs, underground art movements, and the filled in spaces for name and date on old government documents.&nbsp; I like how they are born out of a practical necessity, and used out of a desire for neutrality, but are filled with idiosyncrasies, and always carry just a touch of humanity.
<br><br>
Typewriters are an ancestor of all monospaced fonts.&nbsp; It is this history I wish to tap into when I reach for them.&nbsp; I want to speak in the same neutral voice that permeates our predigital visual world.
<br><br>
And it is this desire that goes unfulfilled, because the monospaced fonts in my typographic toolkit are not timeless and neutral; they are modern.&nbsp; They are built for computers and they look new.
<br><br>
Attempts to mimic the look of typewriters literally look silly and unconvincing.&nbsp; They might try and capture the variability by making some letters lighter than others, but when every "e" has the same ink-splat, the eye knows something is off.
<br><br>
Perhaps a font designer might try and draw the idealized version of a letter, before all the irregularities of the mechanical process are introduced, but design decisions that make sense for a tiny metal stamp don't translate well to digital type, and the end result leaves something to be desired.
<br><br>
I wanted something that imitated the <i>spirit</i> of typewriters, not the literal look, but I wasn't sure such a thing was possible.&nbsp; To avoid looking silly it had to be designed as if for a computer, but somehow incorporate the logic of typewriters.
<br><br>
I started by drawing letters based off of an Underwood typewriter, literally transcribing the gestures.&nbsp; The serifs looked clunky and the ball-terminals, although beautiful, stood out.
<br><br>
I then redrew the same letters with a contemporary sensibility.&nbsp; This new alphabet read nicely and didn't stand out like before, but it looked too modern, and didn't remind me of the past.&nbsp; How could I marry these two?
<br><br>
The answer came from the letter "i."&nbsp; Most monospaced fonts today are also sanserif, but "i," being quite thin, wouldn't take up enough horizontal space.&nbsp; It is common, therefore, to add serifs to "i" to make it wide enough.&nbsp; Most sanserif monospaced fonts are not <i>fully</i> sanserif, they have a couple letters, like "i" or "l" that, out of necessity, have serifs.
<br><br>
What if I were to expand this "mixed serif" logic to other letters?&nbsp; What if I were to break a revered rule of type-design?
<br><br>
I created a hybrid alphabet, mixing serif and sanserif letters together.&nbsp; Sometimes half-committing, like "n" which has a serif on top but none on bottom.&nbsp; There's something tremendously inconsistent about this approach, but somewhere in that inconsistency lay the spirit of typewriters that I was looking to capture.
<br><br>
I moved forward, guided only by this sense of spirit.&nbsp; Ball-terminals were too on the nose, but without them "c" and "r" looked off.&nbsp; Putting a toothy wedge serif on the "r," like those found on "z" did the trick, but on a "c" looked angular and too modern.&nbsp; I instead created the <i>feeling</i> of a serif on the "c" by tightening the top curve, shaping it downward and to the right, as if starting to draw a ball but giving up before completion.
<br><br>
The resulting alphabet is weird, wildly inconsistent, and contains design decisions that if you were to explain out-loud to me I would reject as being overly stylistic and distracting.
<br><br>
Yet when I look at text written in it, I don't see a series of wacky design decisions.&nbsp; I see something that looks familiar.&nbsp; I don't see a period that's unusually bold, an "A" with a top serif and no bottom serifs, or the "4" that slants to the right and extends below the baseline.&nbsp; I see a neutral, professional, and human voice that's tonally consistent with that of a typewriter.
<br><br>
And so, <i>Drafting* Mono</i> is born.&nbsp; An ode to our past.&nbsp; A celebration of inconsistencies.&nbsp; An embrace of that stage of a project where it's real enough to need a script, but still unfinished enough that those reading it are the trusted few tasked with bringing it to life.&nbsp; A placeholder font for a first-draft, and a promise of what's to come.
<br><br>
This is only the beginning.
