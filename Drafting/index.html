<h1 contenteditable="true">Drafting* Mono</h1>
<p contenteditable="true">This is Drafting* Mono, my latest typographic project. I have been noticing that I reach for mono-spaced typefaces in my own work quite a bit (see Lilac, Fluxus Game for Two) but that I am dissatisfied with the existing options. I like mono-spaced fonts because they remind me of typewriters, but most are very modern looking, and the ones that are made to look exactly like typewriters feel silly. I'm trying to make something that feels old school without literally imitating a typewriter. This is Drafting* Mono. You can try it out by editing this paragraph. It should have a complete alphabet, basic punctuation, and numbers. Let me know what you think!<br><br>- Owen</p>
