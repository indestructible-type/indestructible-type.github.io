			<h2><br>&#x2698; Spreading the Word</h2>
			<p>You&#8217;re here because you just read my <a href="rant.html"><u>long rant about ahistoric Cooper revivals</a></u>, and you want to help spread the word. I&#8217;m compiling a possible actions you can take. <b>Do not harass Miles Newlyn,</b> or anybody for that matter.</p>
			<p>Don&#8217;t hesitate to <u><a href="mailto:indestructibletype@gmail.com">email me</a></u> if you think of something that is missing from this list, a person to contact or place to post. I don't have much experience trying to create buzz so I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s stuff I haven&#8217;t considered. Please do also reach out if there&#8217;s something on this list that you think doesn&#8217;t belong.</p>
			<h2>&#x2698; Steps I&#8217;m Taking:</h2>
			
			<p><br><b>Telling my friends and family</b>
			<br>This is the most obvious way that information travels. If they tell all their friends and family and the trend continues eventually everyone will hear about it. Also they might think of ways to spread the word that I haven&#8217;t considered.</p>
			
			<p><b><br>Using my platform(s)</b>
			<br>I&#8217;m writing about it here on my website, but also I&#8217;m posting about it on social media. If you have a lot of Instagram followers or a podcast, maybe talk about it there?</p>
			
			<p><b><br>Reaching out to people with a platform</b>
			<br>I&#8217;m writing emails to reporters and journalists I respect, as well as sending it to <q>general submissions</q> of magazines that might be interested. I don&#8217;t want to be disrespectful and inundate people with tons of emails saying essentially the same thing, so I&#8217;m reluctant to list specific names, but if you think of someone/somewhere that might be interested in this story, reach out.</p>

			<p><b><br>Contacting the <i>Eye on Design</i> editorial team</b>
			<br>Emails: <i><u><a href="mailto:submit@aiga.org">EoD general submissions</u></a>, <u><a href="mailto:hello@lizstinson.net">Liz Stinson</a></u>, & <u><a href="mailto:jarrettfuller@gmail.com">Jarrett Fuller</a></u></i>
			<br>I am specifically listing <i>Eye on Design</i> as a place worth contacting because <a href="https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/cooper-black-never-went-out-of-style-so-why-does-it-need-a-redesign/"><u>their article on <i>New Kansas</i></u></a> includes false information. It has a photo of <i>Cooper BT</i> that it misidentifies as being the original Cooper. If you see misinformation elsewhere you should reach out to them so they can correct it, and also maybe email me about it.</p>

			<div class="no-display"><p><br><b>Emily Gosling</b>
			<br><i><u><a href="mailto:emilygosling9@gmail.com">This is her email</u></a></i></p>
			<p>Emily Gosling is the person who wrote the <i>Eye on Design</i> article that includes false information. I&#8217;m not sure if she&#8217;s still associated with the magazine or not, but I figured she&#8217;d like to know.</p>
