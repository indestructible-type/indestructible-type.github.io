			<h2><br>&#x2698; Contacting the Media</h2>
			<p>You&#8217;re here because you just read my <a href="rant.html"><u>long rant about ahistoric Cooper revivals</a></u>, and you want to help spread the word. I&#8217;m compiling a list of people/media that I&#8217;m personally reaching out to. In my experience stories are more likely to get picked up if it seems like a lot of people are interested in them, so if you want to reach out to these folks as well please do. Just be <i>respectful</i> and be <i>kind</i>. <b>Do not harass Miles Newlyn.</b> His transgressions are strictly professional, and so, if there are consequences, they should be less people commissioning him for work, <b>not personal attacks or harassment.</b> I feel silly clarifying this, but I know how bulling and anger prone the internet can be.</p>
			<p>Please, don&#8217;t hesitate to <u><a href="mailto:indestructibletype@gmail.com">email me</a></u> if you think of someone that you feel is missing from this list, and feel free to reach out too if you are on this list and you don&#8217;t want to be.</p>
			<h2>&#x2698; People I&#8217;m Contacting:</h2>

			<p><br><b>The <i>Eye on Design</i> Editorial Team</b>
			<br><i><u><a href="mailto:submit@aiga.org">EoD general submissions</u></a>, <u><a href="mailto:hello@lizstinson.net">Liz Stinson</a></u>, & <u><a href="mailto:jarrettfuller@gmail.com">Jarrett Fuller</a></u></i></p>
			<p><i>Eye on Design</i> is an online magazine dedicated to all things graphic design. I&#8217;m reaching out to them because this is the kind of news they cover, but more importantly, <a href="https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/cooper-black-never-went-out-of-style-so-why-does-it-need-a-redesign/"><u>their article on <i>New Kansas</i> includes false information</u></a>.</p>

			<p><br><b>Emily Gosling</b>
			<br><i><u><a href="mailto:emilygosling9@gmail.com">This is her email</u></a></i></p>
			<p>Emily Gosling is the person who wrote the <i>Eye on Design</i> article that includes false information. I&#8217;m not sure if she&#8217;s still associated with the magazine or not, but I figured she&#8217;d like to know.</p>

It&#8217;s informative, engaging, and well-researched.</p>
