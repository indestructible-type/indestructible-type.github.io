			<p>While doing research for my font <u><a href="index.html"><i>Cooper*</i></a></u>, I couldn&#8217;t help but learn about the Cooper revivals other font foundries offer. I expected that this project would not be unique in the sense that it&#8217;s a Cooper revival, but I figured it would still be worthwhile as I planned on making my font free and open source, and other foundries&#8217; fonts cost money.</p>
			<p>However, the more I learned about other foundries&#8217; Cooper revivals, the more confused, disappointed, and angry I became. There is a shocking lack of research, regard for basic facts, or respect for the legacy of Oz Cooper out there, and I&#8217;m left feeling conflicted about what to do.</p>
			<p>In the end I have decided to publish my findings. I am bitter, and I feel guilty about putting that bitterness into the world, but I also want to correct an injustice. Oswald Cooper made a pretty good typeface a hundred years ago, and as designers I feel we have a responsibility to honor those who came before us.</p>
			<p>I hope in a hundred years time someone will do the same for me.</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">&#x2767;</p>
			<p>First and foremost, I would like to give my flowers to the Japanese type foundry <u><a href="https://wordshape.com/" target="_blank"><i>Wordshape</i></a></u>. Their regular-weighted Cooper revival is well researched, and clearly done with a lot of respect to Oz Cooper and his legacy. Their typeface <a href="https://wordshape.com/font/cooper-text/" target="_blank"><u><i>Cooper Text</i></u></a> shares many similarities with <i>Cooper*</i>, however <i>Cooper Text</i> includes ornamental initials (which my font does not). These ornamental capitals are beautiful and based on Oz Cooper&#8217;s designs. Currently <i>Wordshape</i> is the only place in the world they can be found. Their font is well worth the $25 price tag and makes a nice companion font to <i>Cooper*.</i> <i>Wordshape</i> does not currently offer a complete Cooper family, so <i>Cooper*</i> still marks a significant first in terms of Cooper revivals, but I would be remiss if I didn&#8217;t mention <i>Wordshape</i> as they are the first to do a historically accurate, regularly weighted Cooper. Please check out their foundry.</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">&#x2767;</p>
			<p>If you search for <q>Cooper</q> on a font marketplace such as <i>MyFonts,</i> it will return several Cooper font families with a range of weights, such as Bitstream&#8217;s <u><a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/cooper-font-bitstream" target="_blank"><i>Cooper BT</i></a></u> or URW Type Foundry&#8217;s <u><a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/cooper-old-style-font-urw" target="_blank"><i>Cooper Old Style.</i></a></u> The lighter weight versions of these typefaces share little resemblance to Oswald Cooper&#8217;s original designs.</p>

			<p>I can only speculate as to what&#8217;s going on here and why these fonts look the way they do. To my eyes URW&#8217;s <i>Cooper Old Style</i> is the more historically accurate one. Most of its letters resemble the original, although there&#8217;s a certain crudeness or roughness to them, as if they have been photocopied several times and lost some of their clarity in the process. Thin lines have become thicker, and some of the details have been rounded off. Bizarrely some letters are completely inaccurate. The lowercase <q>g</q> for example looks nothing like the original, nor does the <q>3.</q></p>
			<p id="URW">To give URW Type Foundry the benefit of the doubt here, I&#8217;m guessing that whatever they were using as a reference when making this font was incomplete and of poor quality. Their reference probably didn&#8217;t include a lowercase <q>g</q> so they guessed what it might have looked like based off of the italic. Maybe their reference really was photocopied many times and the crudeness is not their fault.</p>
			<p>If URW&#8217;s <i>Cooper Old Style</i> were released today there would be no excuse for this, as the University of Michigan has made a <u><a href="http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015061016286" target="_blank">copy of the 1934 <i>American Type Founders</i> catalog available online for free</u></a>, which includes a complete character set for Cooper, but maybe this font was made long ago before the internet was as expansive. In any case, it is neither a particularly accurate Cooper, nor is it a well-made font in my opinion.</p>
			<p>Bitstream/Paratype&#8217;s <i>Cooper BT</i> shares little if any resemblance to the original Cooper. There is much less contrast between thick and thin lines, making it unsuitable for laying out passages of text. The curved, smiling serifs at the bottom of the <q>r</q> or <q>l</q> have been flattened into straight lines (or perhaps ovals). Ascending letters such as <q>k</q> and <q>l</q> are comparatively short. I could go on, but I&#8217;d be laboring the point. These are different typefaces, and much of the personality has been lost.</p>
			<p>Which is not to say that I dislike <i>Cooper BT.</i> To me, the original Cooper evokes the time period from which is comes: the 1920s. <i>Cooper BT</i> on the other hand evokes the 60s and 70s, decades that famously saw a resurgence in popularity for <i>Cooper Black</i>. It is a well constructed font with a personality and identity of its own, and when used properly is pleasing and stylish.</p>

			<h3>This version of the Breaking Bad logo I got from Wikipedia uses Cooper BT</h3>
			<p>There isn&#8217;t a ton of information online about <i>Cooper BT,</i> but what is available is instructive:</p>
			<p class="quote red">Bitstream Cooper was designed at Bitstream in 1986 by means of <b>adding light,</b> medium, and bold styles, with the corresponding italics, <b>to the existing black</b> ones.</q>
			<p>In other words, the folks over at Bitstream were apparently unaware that a non-bold version of Cooper had already existed for over six decades when they made <i>Cooper BT</i> so instead of just going with Oz Cooper&#8217;s designs, they took it upon themselves to <i>invent</i> a light version of Cooper to match <i>Cooper Black.</i> </p>
			<p>Throwing out half of a typefaces&#8217;s styles so you can reverse engineer what the tossed styles <i>might</i> look like is a interesting intellectual exercise, and in the case of  <i>Cooper BT</i> it has yielded worthwhile results. However, I do feel Bitstream/Paratype have a responsibility to update their font&#8217;s descriptions to clarify that there <i>was</i> a historical non-bold version of Cooper which looks very different from the one they&#8217;re selling. Otherwise they are giving the false impression that no such font ever existed. It&#8217;s not 1986 anymore; this information is readily available.</p>
			<p>And to be perfectly honest, I imagine this information wasn&#8217;t terribly difficult to come by in 1986. I managed to walk myself into a public library and look at a copy of <i>The Book of Oz Cooper</i> the old-fashioned way while researching this, and I have no money or institutional backing. In fact, I somehow managed to consult multiple physical books, books that existed in the 80s.</p>
			<p>I&#8217;m frustrated by this whole situation, but neither the crudeness of URW&#8217;s revival, nor the apparent lack of research done by the Bitstream team bother me quite as much as Mr. Miles Newlyn.</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">&#x2767;</p>
			<p id="newlyn"><a href="https://newlyn.com/about" target="_blank"><u>Miles Newlyn</a></u> is a typographer out of London who&#8217;s worked with some of the biggest brands on earth. He&#8217;s done work with Cadillac, the Tate museum, and more recently, <u><a href="https://newlyn.com/blog/long-live-the-king" target="_blank">Burger King</u></a>. In 2020 he decided to try his hand at <a href="https://newlyn.com/blog/cooper-black-made-new" target="_blank"><u>a Cooper revival</a></u>&mdash;or rather <q>an improvement over the original, <span style="font-weight: 900">whose lighter weights have become dated.</span></q></p>
			<p><u><a href="https://newlyn.com/blog/cooper-black-made-new" target="_blank">According to his website</u></a>:</p>
			<p class="quote red">Cooperâ€™s bulbous, <b style="font-weight: 900">oval serifs</b> had not been modernised. There has been very little professional reappraisal of Cooper as a font family, and even less in that <b style="font-weight: 900">elliptical serif style.</b></q>
			<p>The emphasis (in both quotes) is mine. He describes Cooper&#8217;s serifs as oval or elliptical, but looking at the original Cooper, would you describe its serifs as ovals?</p>
			<img src="NewKansasCorrect.svg"/>
			<h3>Just to be clear I&#8217;m talking about what&#8217;s inside the red ovals. I realize the irony in using ovals to highlight what I&#8217;m talking about.</h3>
			<p>I wouldn&#8217;t. They look like crescents or little smiles to me. In fact, it doesn&#8217;t really sound like he&#8217;s describing the original Cooper at all; it kind of sounds like he&#8217;s describing <i>Cooper BT.</i> He removes all doubt when he includes a photo on his website of the <q>original</q> cooper:</p>
			<img src="newKansasCooper.svg"/>
			<h3>This is from <a href="https://newlyn.com/blog/cooper-black-made-new" target="_blank"><u>his website</u></a>.</h3>
			<p>Those serifs do look a lot more like ovals, but that&#8217;s not the original Cooper: it&#8217;s an ahistorical fiction concocted by Bitstream in the 80s.</p>
			<p>Bitstream has unknowingly set the perfect trap, and Newlyn has fallen right into it. Presumably he read somewhere, correctly, that <i>Cooper Black</i> originally had a lightweight counterpart, and, remembering this factoid, assumed, understandably, that Bitstream and Paratype had done their due-diligence and were selling something that in some way resembled the original Cooper and not just something they had invented out of whole cloth.</p>
			<p>What&#8217;s particularly unfortunate is that Mr. Miles Newlyn goes on to criticize the <q>original</q> Cooper, characterizing it as outdated, lacking in consistency, and unsuitable for laying out passages of text. All of which are problems his font solves, available now for $1,400 USD.</p>
			<p>Which, <i>of course</i> Cooper is inconsistent, if you&#8217;re going off of <i>Cooper BT.</i> One part was made over half a century after the other by entirely different people using vastly different technologies.</p>
			<p>Imagine if you had spent years of your life bringing a piece of art into this world, a book perhaps, and for some reason somebody tossed out the first half of the book, only to go on to claim that you never wrote a first half (despite a wealth of easily available documentary evidence that you had). That person then writes a worse version of the first half of the book, only for someone else to stumble upon this new version of the book, think you wrote it all, and criticize you for how bad the first half of the book is.</p>
			<p>It&#8217;s disgraceful. It&#8217;s disrespectful to Oswald Cooper, his work, and his legacy. I don&#8217;t think his work looks outdated no do I think it looks inconsistent, and frankly I think it&#8217;s superior for laying out passages of text than Newlyn&#8217;s <q>improved</q> version. There are good faith critiques one can raise about Cooper&#8217;s typeface, but the ones Newlyn raises on his website are based in factual inaccuracies.</p>
			<p>Whatever patience I have for URW or Bitstream I do not have for Miles Newlyn. This kind of research would have been easy to do in 2020, when Newlyn made his font. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Black" target="_blank"><u>The Wikipedia page for <i>Cooper Black</i></u></a> has had an accurate picture of the lighter weight Cooper in its gallery since 2017. Bitstream and Paratype don&#8217;t cast Oswald Cooper&#8217;s work in a negative light to sell their own, and <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/cooper-bt-font-paratype" target="_blank"><u><i>Cooper BT</i> only costs $150 USD</a></u>, almost a tenth of the price of Newlyn&#8217;s offering.</p>
			<p>If I had spent over a thousand dollars on Newlyn&#8217;s font, only to glance at a <i>Wikipedia</i> article and realize he sold me that font using misinformation, I would feel cheated. It&#8217;s lazy, it&#8217;s sloppy, it&#8217;s disrespectful, and I&#8217;m embarrassed for what it says about type design as a profession. This man is doing work with multi-million dollar companies. Is this the kind of attitude people need to get ahead in this profession? If that&#8217;s the case than I&#8217;m not sure if I want to be a font designer.</p>
			<p>I hope that Mr. Miles Newlyn has simply made a very unfortunate and rather avoidable mistake. I hope he just failed to check <i>Wikipedia</i>, or the description of the Bitstream font he bought, or consult a book while researching his Cooper revival, because if he <i>had,</i> and published his blog post containing false information anyway, then he would be knowingly lying, and knowingly slandering the work of Oswald Cooper, and I&#8217;d rather believe that he is very lazy, and hasn&#8217;t bothered to do the bare minimum when it comes research, than to think he is knowingly lying.</p>
			<p>But it&#8217;s difficult for me to believe this whole situation came about due to ignorance. <u><a href="https://newlyn.com/blog/cooper-black-made-new" target="_blank">His blog post</u></a> includes a plethora of well-researched information about Oz Cooper and his font. There is, for example, a simply charming photo of Oz with <q>his prize winning flowers.</q> There&#8217;s also this picture of an earlier draft of Cooper Black:</p>
			<img src="cooper-black-early-specimen-01.jpg"/>
			<p>He doesn&#8217;t specify where he came across this image. Maybe he got it from that one <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu91meda2I8" target="_blank"><i>Vox</i> video</u></a>, (you know I had to mention it at some point) or maybe he got it from page 79 of <i>The Book of Oz Cooper.</i></p>
			<img src="gun.jpg"/>
			<h3>Oh hey! <u><a href="index.html#italic-quote-from-earlier">It&#8217;s the quote about italics from my Cooper* page!</a></u></h3>
			<p>It probably goes without saying, but <i>The Book of Oz Cooper,</i> a book dedicated to the life and work of Oz Cooper, makes it pretty clear that <i>Cooper Black</i> was first released with a non-bold counterpart, and it&#8217;s also pretty clear what that font looked like considering <b>the entire book is written using Cooper.</b> It&#8217;s almost as if the original version of Cooper was pretty well suited for laying out passages of text. </p>
			<p>Also I know he didn&#8217;t get this picture from the <i>Vox</i> video because I compared the images and the ink splotches are different. Not that it matters because the <i>Vox</i> video, crazily enough, includes historically accurate images of Cooper.</p>
			<p>I&#8217;m not going to bore you with my musings about the importance of factual accuracy or how this is somehow indicative of the downfall of civilized society, but I will say this: Miles Newlyn&#8217;s disregard for the truth is not a one-off. I&#8217;ve been a type designer for years now, and I have some familiarity with the culture surrounding type design and graphic design more broadly. Telling an interesting story and sounding smart and educated is far more important than actually knowing what it is you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
			<p>It&#8217;s a pity because it&#8217;s often unnecessary. <u><a href="https://newlyn.com/fonts/new-kansas" target="_blank"><i>New Kansas</u></a>,</i> Miles Newlyn&#8217;s Cooper reinterpretation, is a really well-made font. Newlyn is an expert craftsman and it shows in his work. His font would be good, even without arguing that it&#8217;s an improvement over the original, and personally, I find the story of how Bitstream spent time and energy unnecessarily reinventing the wheel only to make something worse than the original but with potential rather interesting. Why not write about that? Why not argue that <i>New Kansas</i> is the refinement of the accidental experiment that was <i>Cooper BT?</i></p> 
			<p>It&#8217;s impossible to say. The whole situation is disheartening to say the least, and I&#8217;m not totally sure what to do about it, but I am sure that <b>harassing Miles Newlyn would be the wrong thing to do.</b> His transgressions are solely professional, and if there are consequences for him they should remain entirely in the realm of business (i.e. less people buying his fonts or hiring him). I am upset with this man&#8217;s work as a font designer, not as an individual, and I would be devastated if I learned that anyone was bullying or harassing him as a result of my writings. If you&#8217;re feeling particularly upset by this, maybe help try and get the word out? Post about it on social media, tell your friends, or if you have a platform talk about it there. Maybe we can inspire a slight shift within the culture of graphic design.</p>
